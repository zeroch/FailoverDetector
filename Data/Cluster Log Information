Cluster Log Information 


   172 Based on the failure policies for the resource and role, the cluster service may try to bring the resource online on this node or move the group to another node of the cluster and then restart it.  Check the resource and group state using Failover Cluster Manager or the Get-ClusterResource Windows PowerShell cmdlet.
   173 [System] 0000084c.00000f90::2017/10/23-20:16:33.733 ERR   The Cluster service failed to bring clustered role 'ag1023' completely online or offline. One or more resources may be in a failed state. This may impact the availability of the clustered role.
   174 [System] 0000084c.00000c88::2017/10/23-21:20:21.216 DBG   Cluster node 'ze-2016-v2' was removed from the active failover cluster membership. The Cluster service on this node may have stopped. This could also be due to the node having lost communication with other active nodes in the failover cluster. Run the Validate a Configuration wizard to check your network configuration. If the condition persists, check for hardware or software errors related to the network adapters on this node. Also check for failures in any other network components to which the node is connected such as hubs, switches, or bridges.

   177 [System] 000008c8.00000c80::2017/10/23-21:53:54.598 DBG   Cluster node 'ze-2016-v3' was removed from the active failover cluster membership. The Cluster service on this node may have stopped. This could also be due to the node having lost communication with other active nodes in the failover cluster. Run the Validate a Configuration wizard to check your network configuration. If the condition persists, check for hardware or software errors related to the network adapters on this node. Also check for failures in any other network components to which the node is connected such as hubs, switches, or bridges.
   178 [System] 000008c8.00000c80::2017/10/23-21:53:54.600 DBG   The Cluster service is shutting down because quorum was lost. This could be due to the loss of network connectivity between some or all nodes in the cluster, or a failover of the witness disk. 
   179 Run the Validate a Configuration wizard to check your network configuration. If the condition persists, check for hardware or software errors related to the network adapter. Also check for failures in any other network components to which the node is connected such as hubs, switches, or bridges.

   183 [System] 00001e1c.00000d0c::2017/10/23-22:00:35.960 ERR   Cluster failed to start. The latest copy of cluster configuration data was not available within the set of nodes attempting to start the cluster. Changes to the cluster occurred while the set of nodes were not in membership and as a result were not able to receive configuration data updates. .



      190 Attempt to start the cluster service on all nodes in the cluster so that nodes with the latest copy of the cluster configuration data can first form the cluster. The cluster will be able to start and the nodes will automatically obtain the updated cluster configuration data. If there are no nodes available with the latest copy of the cluster configuration data, run the 'Start-ClusterNode -FQ' Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Using the ForceQuorum (FQ) parameter will start the cluster service and mark this node's copy of the cluster configuration data to be authoritative.  Forcing quorum on a node with an outdated copy of the cluster database may result in cluster configuration changes that occurred while the node was not participating in the cluster to be lost.

The node will be quarantined until '2017/10/23-17:19:06.645' and then the node will automatically attempt to re-join the cluster.
   193 
   194 Refer to the System and Application event logs to determine the issues on this node.  When the issue is resolved, quarantine can be manually cleared to allow the node to rejoin with the 'Start-ClusterNode –ClearQuarantine' Windows PowerShell cmdlet.
